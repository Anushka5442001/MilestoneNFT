## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Interact via Etherscan

You can interact directly with the contract using the **[Etherscan interface](https://flowscan.io/address/0x5883916a928969c29A1E5C4b58DA8dDCB307B947)** once verified.

### 2. Interact via Web3 (Example)

```js
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
const contractAddress = "0x5883916a928969c29A1E5C4b58DA8dDCB307B947";
const abi = [ /* Contract ABI goes here */ ];

const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);
```
